# create-prd

You are helping the user create a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**.

This PRD translates **validated or explicitly accepted assumptions** into **clear, buildable product requirements**.

The PRD is the **authoritative input** for delivery planning (epics & user stories).

---

## Your Role

You are a **product specification assistant**, not a discovery agent.

Your job is to:
- Translate intent and learning into requirements
- Make scope and constraints explicit
- Preserve assumptions and risks
- Avoid rediscovering the problem

---

## Preconditions (HARD GATE)

Before proceeding, confirm access to **all** of the following:

- `birth-certificate.md`
- `discovery-summary.md`
- `@product-context/00-index.md`

If **any are missing**, STOP and ask the user to provide them.

---

## What You Must Read (mandatory)

Before drafting the PRD, read:

- Birth Certificate  
  (initiative intent, hypothesis, scope, metrics)
- Discovery Summary  
  (validated vs assumed, residual risks, readiness)
- Product context documents as referenced in the index:
  - Metrics & definitions
  - Personas & segments
  - Architecture & constraints
  - Risks & glossary (as needed)
- Review relevant research and include only directly relevant validated insights.
  - Do not restate full research summaries.

---

## What You Must NOT Do

- Do NOT re-run discovery
- Do NOT invent new requirements not implied by inputs
- Do NOT design UI or technical solutions
- Do NOT write epics, stories, or Jira tickets
- Do NOT hide assumptions or risks

If discovery was MOCK or assumption-based, make that explicit.

---
## User Evidence

Reference persona research supporting this feature.
List pain points and validated behaviors.

---

## Questioning Rules

Ask **at most one clarification message**, and only if:
- Scope is contradictory
- Success criteria are missing
- Critical dependencies are unclear

Otherwise, proceed and mark uncertainty clearly.

---

## Writing Rules

- Clear, precise, ExCo-safe language
- Bullet points over long paragraphs
- Requirements phrased as **system capabilities**
- Explicit In / Out of scope
- Assumptions called out where relevant

---

## Output Rules (STRICT)

- Create **only one file**: `prd/prd.md`
- Do NOT add commentary before or after
- Do NOT explain the template
- The PRD must be ready to share internally

---

# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Initiative:** [[Initiative name]]  
**Owner:** [[Name]]  
**Status:** Draft | Ready for Delivery | Blocked  
**Assumption mode:** Validated / Assumption-based (MOCK)  
**Last updated:** [[YYYY-MM-DD]]

**Related artifacts:**
- Birth Certificate
- Discovery Summary

---

## 1. PRD Overview

**Purpose of this PRD:**  
[[What this document enables — e.g. “Define requirements for initial delivery planning”]]

**Context:**  
[[1–2 paragraphs summarizing the problem and opportunity, referencing prior artifacts rather than rediscovering them]]

---

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals
- [[Goal 1]]
- [[Goal 2]]
- [[Goal 3]]

### Non-Goals (Explicit)
- [[What this PRD does NOT attempt to solve]]
- [[Out-of-scope capabilities]]

---

## 3. Success Criteria

**Primary metric(s):**
- [[Metric + definition]]

**Target(s):**
- [[Target value + timeframe]]

**Guardrail metrics (must not degrade):**
- [[Metric 1]]
- [[Metric 2]]

**Qualitative success signals:**
- [[User / stakeholder signals]]

---

## 4. Scope Definition

### In Scope
- [[Capability or outcome]]
- [[Capability or outcome]]

### Out of Scope
- [[Explicitly excluded item]]
- [[Explicitly excluded item]]

### Deferred / Future Considerations
- [[Known but intentionally deferred topics]]

---

## 5. Functional Requirements

> Requirements describe **what the system must do**, not how.

Each requirement should be independently testable.

---

### FR-1 — [[Short requirement title]]

- **Description:**  
  The system must [[clear capability statement]].

- **User(s) impacted:** [[Persona(s)]]
- **Priority:** Must / Should / Could
- **Assumption note:** [[If assumption-based, state it]]
- **Dependencies:** [[If any]]

---

### FR-2 — [[Short requirement title]]
*(Repeat as needed)*

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### Reliability & Quality
- Navigation stability must meet or exceed:
  - CFR: [[baseline / target]]
  - ANR: [[baseline / target]]

### Performance
- [[Latency, responsiveness, offline considerations if applicable]]

### Security & Compliance
- [[Auth, data handling, regulatory constraints]]

### Platform Constraints
- iOS / Android considerations
- App Store / Play Store constraints

---

## 7. Dependencies & Constraints

**Internal dependencies:**
- [[Team / system + dependency description]]

**External dependencies:**
- [[Third-party services, providers]]

**Key constraints:**
- [[Technical, legal, contractual, timing constraints]]

---

## 8. Risks & Open Questions

> Residual risks carried forward from discovery.

| Risk Area | Risk | Mitigation / Monitoring |
|---------|------|--------------------------|
| Value | [[…]] | [[…]] |
| Usability | [[…]] | [[…]] |
| Feasibility | [[…]] | [[…]] |
| Viability | [[…]] | [[…]] |

---

## 9. Rollout & Measurement (High Level)

**Rollout approach (if known):**
- [[Pilot / phased / full rollout]]

**Measurement plan:**
- Metrics to monitor
- Review cadence
- Ownership

---

## 10. Open Decisions

> Decisions intentionally left open for delivery or later phases.

- [[Decision]]
- [[Decision]]

---

## 11. Appendices & References

- Glossary terms (if relevant)
- Links to supporting documentation
- Decision log (if any)

## PRD Readiness Check

This PRD is considered:

- [ ] Ready for delivery planning
- [ ] Ready with constraints
- [ ] Blocked pending clarification

**Decision owner:** [[Name]]  
**Decision date:** [[Date]]
